<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
 A <strong>weather application</strong> created using tutorials. This was my first serious contact with using fetch methods in <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>API</strong>. This was also one of the first project created using <strong>webpack</strong>. After entering a given <strong>city</strong>, the weather conditions there are displayed, and the background image changes depending on the <strong>temperature</strong>.
