 <h3>Description</h3>

<p>
As a
<strong>freelancer</strong>,
I was responsible for everything from
<strong>A to Z</strong>.
I started by contacting the client and preparing the
<strong>brief</strong>
and project assumptions. Then I started designing the
<strong>website</strong>.
After the project was accepted, I began
<strong>coding</strong>.
Of course, there were many
<strong>problems</strong>
along the way, I was a very beginner so the responsibility that rested on me
<strong>taught me</strong>
to work under time pressure and stress.
