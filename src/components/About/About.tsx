          I&apos;m 19 years Junior Front-End Developer from Poland. My work is
          my passion, I enjoy building websites and developing my skillset
          because, as I said I&apos;m really into the idea of creating something
          out of nothing on the web. I started back in 2020 with fundamentals of
          web development and started creating my first&apos;s websites. At this
          point, my main focus is building modern and good-looking websites
          along with new technologies, especially my favorite â€“ React.js.
          I&apos;m in 4th-grade Secondary School of Information Technology
