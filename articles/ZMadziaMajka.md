<p>
As a freelancer, I was responsible for everything from A to Z. I started by contacting the client and preparing the brief and project assumptions. Then I started designing the website. After the project was accepted, I began coding. Of course, there were many problems along the way, I was a very beginner so the responsibility that rested on me taught me to work under time pressure and stress.
