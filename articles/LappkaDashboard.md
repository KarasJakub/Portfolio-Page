<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
The primary <strong>goal</strong> of the <strong>Łappka</strong> application was to bring together animal shelters from Poland into one <strong>centralized</strong> platform. Through the management panel, shelters could register and efficiently <strong>manage</strong> their animals, staff, and volunteers. Simultaneously, the <strong>mobile</strong> app for clients allowed them to discover and adopt their beloved pets while also <strong>reporting</strong> any lost animals.
</p>

<p>
I had the opportunity to contribute to this project during my participation in the <strong>Mobitouch</strong> mLAB internship. We worked in three teams: Front-End (React), Back-End (.NET), and Mobile (Flutter) developers. Alongside two other <strong>Front-End</strong> developers, I was responsible for creating the Łappka Dashboard using <strong>React.js</strong>.
